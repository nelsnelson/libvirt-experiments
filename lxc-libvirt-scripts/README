These scripts tries to allow the libvirt lxc driver to leverage the
great work being done by Daniel Lezcano and the other developers of
lxc.sf.net.

It's quite ubuntu-specific, so should probably be renamed.

It uses the container creation 'templates' from lxc.sf.net to
create a rootfs, tweaks that to something libvirt can use, then
defines a libvirt-lxc domain.  So, you can start an ubuntu
lucid container by doing:

	lxc-libvirt-create.sh u1
	virsh -c lxc:// start u1

The container should be started up with ssh running, with user
root password root.  You *can* attach to the console doing

	virsh -c lxc:// console u1

but once you log that session out, the container dies!  So I
recommend not doing it unless you're debugging :)

Instead, look at /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases on the host to
find the ip address assigned to the container, and then ssh
to it.

TODO PLANS

Add shutdown script :)

Cache the ip address somewhere easier to find.

Add a vnc server running gdm.

Figure out how to not kill the container when console exits.
